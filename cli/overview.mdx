description: Introduction to the Helix CLI and common usage patterns
---

The Helix CLI is the primary tool for managing HelixDB projects, instances, and deployments. It provides commands for local development, cloud deployment, and instance management.

## Installation

The Helix CLI can be installed via the installation script or package managers:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.helix-db.com | sh
```

## Global Flags

All commands support these global flags:

<ParamField path="--quiet" type="boolean">
  Suppress output (errors and final result only)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--verbose" type="boolean" default="false">
  Show detailed output with timing information
</ParamField>

## Project Structure

A typical Helix project has the following structure:

```
my-project/
├── helix.toml          # Project configuration
├── db/                 # Query files directory
│   ├── schema.hx      # Schema definitions
│   └── queries.hx     # Query definitions
└── .helix/            # Instance workspaces (auto-generated)
    └── dev/
```

## Common Workflows

### Local Development

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize a new project">
    Create a new Helix project in the current directory:
    ```bash
    helix init
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build and deploy locally">
    Build your queries and start a local instance:
    ```bash
    helix push dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check status">
    View the status of all instances:
    ```bash
    helix status
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="View logs">
    Monitor your instance logs:
    ```bash
    helix logs dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Cloud Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Log in to Helix Cloud:
    ```bash
    helix auth login
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize with cloud">
    Create a new cloud-deployed project:
    ```bash
    helix init cloud
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to cloud">
    Push your project to Helix Cloud:
    ```bash
    helix push production
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync changes">
    Pull changes from your cloud instance:
    ```bash
    helix sync production
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Instance Types

Helix supports multiple instance types:

### Local Instances

Local instances run in Docker containers on your machine. They're ideal for development and testing.

```toml
[local.dev]
port = 6969
```

### Helix Cloud Instances

Managed instances on Helix Cloud with automatic scaling and high availability.

```toml
[cloud.production]
type = "helix"
cluster_id = "cluster_abc123"
region = "us-east-1"
build_mode = "release"
```

### Enterprise Instances

High-availability enterprise deployments with custom node configurations.

```toml
[enterprise.prod-ha]
cluster_id = "cluster_xyz789"
availability_mode = "ha"
gateway_node_type = "c5.2xlarge"
db_node_type = "r5.4xlarge"
min_instances = 3
max_instances = 10
```

## Configuration File

The `helix.toml` file configures your project:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
queries = "./db/"
container_runtime = "docker"

[local.dev]
port = 6969

[cloud.production]
type = "helix"
cluster_id = "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID"
region = "us-east-1"
build_mode = "release"
```

## Getting Help

Get help for any command:

```bash
helix --help
helix <command> --help
```

## Update the CLI

Keep your CLI up to date:

```bash
helix update
```

The CLI automatically checks for updates and notifies you when a new version is available.

## Why HelixDB?

You no longer need a separate application DB, vector DB, graph DB, or application layers to manage multiple storage locations. Just use Helix.

HelixDB primarily operates with a **graph + vector data model**, but it can also support key-value, documents, and relational data.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Built-in MCP Tools" icon="robot">
    Helix has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than generating human-readable queries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built-in Embeddings" icon="vector-square">
    No need to embed your data before sending it to Helix. Just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tooling for RAG" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Built-in vector search, keyword search, and graph traversals that power any type of RAG applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure by Default" icon="shield-halved">
    Private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled HelixQL queries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ultra-Low Latency" icon="bolt">
    Built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type-Safe Queries" icon="check-double">
    HelixQL is 100% type-safe, letting you develop and deploy with confidence that your queries will execute in production.
  </Card>

## Unified Data Model

HelixDB combines graph, vector, and document capabilities in a single query language. Define your schema, write type-safe queries, and deploy instantly.

<CodeGroup>
```hql Schema Definition
N::User {
    INDEX name: String,
    age: U32
}

N::Document {
    content: String
}

V::Embedding {
    text: String
}

E::Owns {
    From: User,
    To: Document,
    Properties: {
        created_at: I64
    }
}
```

```hql Query Example
QUERY getUserDocuments(user_name: String) =>
    user <- N<User>({name: user_name})
    docs <- user::Out<Owns>
    RETURN docs
```

```hql Vector Search
QUERY semanticSearch(query_text: String, limit: U32) =>
    query_vec <- Embed(query_text)
    results <- V<Embedding>::Search(query_vec, limit)
    RETURN results
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  HelixQL queries are compiled to type-safe Rust code, ensuring runtime safety and optimal performance.

## Developer Experience

HelixDB is designed for developers who want to move fast without sacrificing safety or performance.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Get started with a single command:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL "https://install.helix-db.com" | bash
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initialize your project">
    Create a new project with schema and query templates:
    ```bash
    helix init
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Write queries">
    Define your schema and queries in `.hx` files with full type safety.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy instantly">
    Push your queries to a running instance:
    ```bash
    helix push dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
